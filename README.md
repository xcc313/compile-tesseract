This documents the steps that I used to compile tesseract for iOS7, Mavericks with 3.02 of tesseract and leptonica-1.69

It was based on this blog entry here: http://tinsuke.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/how-to-compile-and-use-tesseract-3-01-on-ios-sdk-5/

I updated the version number, list of header files, and a few other paths that had changed.
